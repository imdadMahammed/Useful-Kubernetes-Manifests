# Useful Kubernetes Manifests

This repository contains a collection of Kubernetes manifest files useful for deploying a variety of applications and services in a Kubernetes environment. These manifests are designed to help Kubernetes administrators and developers quickly deploy common services and configure them according to best practices.

## Repository Structure

Each directory in the repository corresponds to a specific Kubernetes application or service. Here's what you can expect to find:

- **nginx/** - Manifests for deploying the Nginx web server.
- **postgres/** - Manifests for setting up a PostgreSQL database.
- **redis/** - Configuration files for deploying a Redis cache.
- **prometheus/** - Setup for Prometheus monitoring.
- **custom-apps/** - Custom applications developed specifically for our use case.

## Getting Started

To use these manifests, you'll need a Kubernetes cluster. You can apply any of these manifests to your cluster using `kubectl`, like so:

```bash
kubectl apply -f [manifest-file.yaml]
```

Replace `[manifest-file.yaml]` with the path to the manifest file you wish to deploy.

## Prerequisites

- A working Kubernetes cluster
- `kubectl` configured to communicate with your cluster

## Usage

Navigate to the directory of the service you want to deploy and read the specific `README.md` for detailed instructions on deploying that service.

For example, to deploy Nginx:

```bash
cd nginx
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
```
